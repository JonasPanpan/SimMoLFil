# SimMoLFil
A Mode-Locked Fiber Laser (MoLFil) simulator.

## General info
This project simulates pulses generation and evolution in mode-locke fiber lasers.
The pulse evolution in fiber is calcuated by solving GNLSE using Interaction Picture Method Algorithm [[1](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6153336)].
The codes were originally written for this paper [[2](https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-25-4-4414)].
This project currently contains only a minimum amount of the whole codes used in [[2](https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-25-4-4414)].

## Technologies
The project is created with:
* MATLAB version: 2016b

## Examples
mainP1.m: run a simulation and produce results of Point 1 of Figure 2 in [[2](https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-25-4-4414)].
